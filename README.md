## Grand Challenges of Computing Project

This research focuses on developing multimodal artificial intelligence systems for the detection and classification of gastrointestinal (GI) diseases by combining both visual and textual data modalities. The project leverages state-of-the-art neural network architectures: EfficientNetV2, Vision Transformers, Swin Transformers, and BioClinical BERT to process and analyze endoscopic images as well as textual information like pathology reports. The current scope encompasses various GI conditions and anatomical landmarks, including polyps, esophagitis, ulcerative colitis, and specialized endoscopic imaging of dyed-lifted polyps and resection margins, as well as normal anatomical structures such as the cecum, pylorus, and Z-line.
